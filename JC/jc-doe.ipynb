    "# Design of Experiments for the JC Cracker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we set up an initial experimental design for the JC Cracker using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) with 40 experiments. The purpose is to capture a highly nonlinear response surface of our system with 6 key variables. Later, we use Bayesian optimization to refine the experimental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Variables and Their Ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Soaking Time (Hours):** 5 to 50\n",
    "2. **Air-Drying Time (Minutes):** 10 to 60\n",
    "3. **Plate Contact Frequency (Hz):** 30 to 60\n",
    "4. **Throughput Rate (nuts/s):** 12 to 38\n",
    "5. **Crush Amount (inches):** 0.025 to 0.125\n",
    "6. **Entry-Exit Height Difference (inches):** -0.09375 to 0.1875\n",
    "\n",
    "With 40 experiments we can better capture the complex nonlinear interactions you expect. The steps in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Design Space:** Set up variable ranges based on our design of experiments.\n",
    "2. **Generate Initial Design (LHS):** Create 40 initial experimental points that are uniformly distributed across the design space.\n",
    "3. **Define a Dummy Objective Function:** For demonstration purposes, we assume the optimum is at the midpoint of each variable range. In your actual application, this function should return the measured outcome (e.g., yield or quality).\n",
    "4. **Run Bayesian Optimization:** Using `gp_minimize` from scikit-optimize, we refine the search for the best experimental conditions.\n",
    "5. **Plot Convergence:** Visualize the progress of the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to adjust the variable ranges, the number of experiments, or the objective function according to your actual experimental setup.\n",
