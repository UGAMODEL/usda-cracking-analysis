# usda-cracking-analysis

> A USDA-funded research project analyzing pecan cracking efficiency and kernel yield using data analytics, image processing, and mechanical testing.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository hosts data analysis and experimental results for optimizing pecan cracking using full-factorial designs and AI classification techniques at the University of Georgia.

## 🔬 Core Objectives

- Maximize half-kernel yield under different cracking conditions
- Apply image processing for crack-type classification
- Perform DOE-based optimization on key parameters (spring, displacement, motor speed, moisture)
- Build predictive models for better automation and control
